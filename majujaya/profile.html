<h1>Profile</h1>
<p>More than 20 years ago, our founder, Abi Bakir, and a handful
of CV Lumpur Sehat employees shared a dream of creating an
industry-leading firm dedicated to making the world a better
place. On April 6, 2004, PT Maju Jaya evolved to become an independent
firm. While our official founding was in 1990, some
of our predecessor firms had distinguished histories dating
back to the early 1900s.</p>
<p>Since then, more than 40 companies have joined PT Maju Jaya,
and in 2007, we became a publicly traded company on the
Jakarta Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Today, listed on the Forbes as one of Indonesia’s largest
companies, PT Maju Jaya's talented employees — including architects,
engineers, designers, planners, scientists and management
professionals — now serve clients in more than 130
countries around the world. </p>
<p>PT Maju Jaya’s technical expertise and creative excellence
come from the rich history of some of the world’s finest engineering,
environmental, construction management as well as
planning and design companies. From transportation, energy and
water systems to enhancing environments and creating new
buildings and communities, our vision remains constant — to
make the world a better place.
</p>
<p>What sets us apart is our collaborative way of working
globally and delivering locally. A trusted partner to our clients,
we draw together teams of engineers, planners, architects,
landscape architects, environmental specialists, economists,
scientists, consultants, as well as cost construction,
project and program managers dedicated to finding the most innovative
and appropriate solutions to create, enhance and sustain
the world’s built, natural and social environments.</p>
